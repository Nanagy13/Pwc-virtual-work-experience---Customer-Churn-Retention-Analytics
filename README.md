## Project Overview
- Define proper KPI's
- Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPI's
- Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

## Data Sources
Data was provided by pwc 

## Tools
- Power BI

## Data Preparation/Cleaning

- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Data transformation or normalization

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Customers who left within the last month
- Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## Data Analysis 

The below measures were created in DAX:

● Average MonthlyCharges = AVERAGE('01 Churn-Dataset'[MonthlyCharges])

● Average TotalCharges = AVERAGE('01 Churn-Dataset'[TotalCharges])

● churn count = CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]), ALLSELECTED('01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] = "Yes")

● churn rate % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn] = "yes" ), COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]), 0)

● Dependent in % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents]="Yes",'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"), CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Dependents]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"), 0)

● Device protection in % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[DeviceProtection]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[DeviceProtection] ="Yes", '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[DeviceProtection]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),0)

● Online backup in % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[OnlineBackup]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[OnlineBackup] ="Yes", '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[OnlineBackup]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),0)

● Online security in % =DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[OnlineSecurity]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[OnlineSecurity] ="Yes", '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[OnlineSecurity]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),0)

● Partner in % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Partner]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Partner]="Yes",'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"), CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[Partner]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"), 0)

● Phone service in % =DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[PhoneService]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[PhoneService] ="Yes", '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[PhoneService]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),0)

● SenioCitizen in % = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[SeniorCitizen]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[SeniorCitizen]=1,'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"), CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[SeniorCitizen]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"), 0)

● Streaming Movies in % =DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[StreamingMovies]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[StreamingMovies] ="Yes", '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[StreamingMovies]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),0)

● Streaming TV in % =DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[StreamingTV]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[StreamingTV] ="Yes", '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[StreamingTV]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),0)

● Tech Support in % =DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[TechSupport]), '01 Churn-Dataset'[TechSupport] ="Yes", '01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),CALCULATE(COUNT('01 Churn-Dataset'[TechSupport]),'01 Churn-Dataset'[Churn]="Yes"),0)

## Results/Findings

- The dashboard shows a balanced diversity effort in terms of target hires, with most departments achieving nearly 50/50 gender representation, except in more senior roles where the male population is higher.

- The average time in job levels indicates that men spend more time in junior roles before being promoted to senior positions, whereas women are promoted more quickly to higher levels.

- Promotion rates for women are lower compared to men, suggesting there could be underlying bias or structural barriers in career progression.

- Turnover rates are highest in the sales and marketing departments and are particularly high among younger employees, which may indicate dissatisfaction or lack of growth opportunities in these areas.

- Women make up a higher percentage of recent hires, but their turnover rate is concerning, particularly in technical roles where they remain underrepresented.

## Recommendations

- Increase mentorship and leadership development programs aimed at women in junior and mid-level positions to balance the promotion rates between genders.

- Analyze the high turnover rates in sales and marketing departments to understand the underlying causes and address any issues related to job satisfaction, career growth, or work-life balance.

- Encourage greater retention of women in technical roles by providing more opportunities for career development and creating a more supportive working environment.

-Introduce additional programs to retain younger employees, such as clear career advancement paths or job enrichment opportunities.
