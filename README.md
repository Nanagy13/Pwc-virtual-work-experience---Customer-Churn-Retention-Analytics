## Results/Findings

- The dashboard shows a balanced diversity effort in terms of target hires, with most departments achieving nearly 50/50 gender representation, except in more senior roles where the male population is higher.

- The average time in job levels indicates that men spend more time in junior roles before being promoted to senior positions, whereas women are promoted more quickly to higher levels.

- Promotion rates for women are lower compared to men, suggesting there could be underlying bias or structural barriers in career progression.

- Turnover rates are highest in the sales and marketing departments and are particularly high among younger employees, which may indicate dissatisfaction or lack of growth opportunities in these areas.

- Women make up a higher percentage of recent hires, but their turnover rate is concerning, particularly in technical roles where they remain underrepresented.

## Recommendations

- Increase mentorship and leadership development programs aimed at women in junior and mid-level positions to balance the promotion rates between genders.

- Analyze the high turnover rates in sales and marketing departments to understand the underlying causes and address any issues related to job satisfaction, career growth, or work-life balance.

- Encourage greater retention of women in technical roles by providing more opportunities for career development and creating a more supportive working environment.

-Introduce additional programs to retain younger employees, such as clear career advancement paths or job enrichment opportunities.
